    <i>What has it got in its pocketses, precious?!</i>

<br/>

This is a project I'm using to learn snaps, Snapcraft, Ubuntu Core, & landscape. It runs the following "services":

- A collector to pull CPU, memory, and network statistics from the host, and
- A publisher to push the metrics to all subscribed clients

Areas covered:

- [x] Python snap plugin
- [x] Interfaces
- [x] Pub/Sub with the [Twisted](https://twisted.org/) framework
- [x] Remote builds
- [x] Snap configuration
- [x] Hooks
- [x] Snapd REST API
- [x] Model assertions

### Etymology

What's with the project's name I hear you ask? Well, I've been reading Tolkien's legendarium and naming things is hard _(sobs)_, as someone famously quipped. There's an open challenge to come up with a better name. And if it loses, what then? Well, if it loses, precious, then we eats it whole ðŸ™‚.

_Moving on swiftly..._

## Installation

### Source

A few pre-reqs, make sure the following are installed:

- [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview)
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)

Then run `git clone git@github.com:st3v3nmw/pocketses.git` to clone this repository and run `make build && make install`.

### Snap store

The version on the snap store is far behind (I disabled the automatic GitHub + Launchpad builds since we're using the super privileged `snapd-control` interface and you'll get rejections from the snap store). We're using the `snapd-control` interface to get pocketses' snap configuration.

If you'd still like to take the path less traveled by, run `sudo snap install pocketses --channel=candidate`.

## Setup

Connect the snap to the `system-observe`, `network-observe` & `snapd-control` interfaces (`sudo snap connect pocketses:<interface-name>`)

## Usage

As mentioned before, this snap has to be run as root since we need to connect to the `/run/snapd.socket` socket through the `snapd-control` interface. Yes, we should probably switch to the snapctl tool but parsing the output seems unwieldy (plus HTTP/JSON is convenient).

```console
$ sudo pocketses --help
usage: pocketses-cli [-h] [--port PORT] [--interval INTERVAL]

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --port PORT          Port to run server
  --interval INTERVAL  Interval in seconds to collect metrics
```

On one terminal, start pocketses:

```console
$ sudo pocketses
Starting publisher...
Collecting and sending stats...
Collecting and sending stats...
```

On two separate terminals, subscribe with two clients:

```console
$ telnet localhost 8888
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

{"cpu": {"count": 8, "utilization": {"overall": 14.6, "per_cpu": [14.0, 7.0, 15.8, 9.4, 12.1, 11.2, 19.2, 28.0]}, "frequency": {"current": 500.0, "max": 4800.0, "min": 400.0}}, "memory": {"virtual": {"total": "15.4G", "used": "42.1%", "available": "8.9G"}, "swap": {"total": "8.0G", "used": "2.9%", "available": "7.8G"}}, "network": {"traffic": {"sent": "1.4G", "recv": "1.9G"}, "addresses": {"lo": ["127.0.0.1"], "wlp108s0": ["192.168.0.104"], "docker0": ["172.17.0.1"], "lxdbr0": ["10.131.100.1"]}}}
```

You should see some output after the interval elapses (default interval = 60 seconds).

## Bugs/Features

1. Subscribed clients can "publish" and this output is echoed back too all clients (sender included lol)

## Upgrading Ubuntu Core

- Get the model assertion: `snap known --remote model series=16 brand-id=canonical model=ubuntu-core-22-amd64 > uc22.model`
- Start the upgrade: `sudo snap remodel uc22.model`
- Use `snap changes` & `snap change <change-id>` to monitor the process

Count your lucky stars if it passes. Mine didn't:

```console
$ snap change 29
